### INSTALLING HAXEFLIXEL

"How do i install haxeflixel?" or "How do i compile it?" may u ask...

Welp, its very simples!
All u need to do is:

1- Install Haxe: To the other steps work u NEED haxe for it..
OBS: Install 4.2.5 Version, its that which i use :3 

https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/

2- Install Libarys!!: after u installed haxe u gonna need the other things that make this port work!
So open ur CMD Prompt (or press windowButton and R to open the execute and write cmd), and Write theses commands:

`haxelib install lime
haxelib install openfl
haxelib install flixel `

after that u gonna install the aditional libarys so write this command:

`haxelib run lime setup flixel `

to make lime command avaliable write this:
`haxelib run lime setup ` or `haxelib run lime `

to install the flixel commands write this:

`haxelib install flixel-tools
haxelib run flixel-tools setup `

ANDDDD u done :DDDD congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
